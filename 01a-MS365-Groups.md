## Security Groups

- **Primary Purpose:**
  - Control access to resources in Microsoft 365 (SharePoint sites, Teams, applications, etc.).
  - Grant group-wide permissions instead of assigning individual permissions.

- **Types:**
  - **Security-only groups:** Designed solely for permission management.
  - **Mail-enabled security groups:** Combine permission management with the ability to send and receive emails as a group.

- **Flexibility:**
  - Can be manually populated or used with dynamic membership rules (members join or exit automatically based on criteria).

---

## Distribution Groups

- **Function:** Used primarily for sending emails to a group of people.
- **Types:**
  - **Traditional Distribution Groups:** Manually populated with members by an administrator.
  - **Dynamic Distribution Groups (DDGs):** Membership automatically determined based on specific rules and criteria (e.g., department, job title, location).

- **Exchange Online Integration:** Distribution groups are primarily managed through the Exchange admin center.
